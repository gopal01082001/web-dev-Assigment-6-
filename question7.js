// Q.7  Whats Inheritance and Purpose of it?
// Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. In OOP, classes are used to define objects that encapsulate data and behavior. Inheritance provides a way to create new classes based on existing classes, forming a hierarchical relationship between them.
// The purpose of inheritance is to promote code reuse, enhance modularity, and enable the creation of specialized classes based on existing ones. Here are some key aspects of inheritance and its purposes:
// Code Reuse: Inheritance allows the derived class (also known as the child class or subclass) to inherit all the non-private members (attributes and methods) of the base class (also known as the parent class or superclass). This eliminates the need to rewrite common code and promotes efficient development.
// Modularity: Inheritance supports the concept of modular programming by enabling the creation of classes that build upon existing functionality. New classes can extend or override the behavior of the base class, making it easier to manage and organize code.
// Polymorphism: Inheritance facilitates polymorphism, which is the ability of objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This allows for more flexible and generic programming, as different objects can be used interchangeably based on their shared inheritance.
// Specialization: Derived classes can add new attributes and methods or modify the inherited ones to create specialized behavior. This enables the creation of class hierarchies that represent different levels of abstraction and specific types of objects.
// Overall, inheritance provides a mechanism for creating relationships between classes, promotes code reuse, enhances modularity, and facilitates the design and implementation of complex systems in object-oriented programming.
