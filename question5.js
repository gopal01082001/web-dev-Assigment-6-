// Q.5 Whats Abstraction and Its Purpose?
// Abstraction is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that focuses on hiding the implementation details and complexity of objects, while exposing only the essential features and functionality to the outside world. It allows you to create simplified models of real-world entities, making it easier to understand and work with complex systems.
// The purpose of abstraction is to provide a high-level view or interface that allows you to interact with objects without getting into the nitty-gritty details of their internal workings. It helps in managing the complexity of large-scale software systems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable components.
// Here are some key aspects and benefits of abstraction:
// Simplification: Abstraction allows you to represent complex real-world entities or systems in a simplified manner. By focusing on the essential features and hiding unnecessary details, it makes the code more readable and easier to understand.
// Modularity: Abstraction helps in creating modular code by dividing a system into smaller, self-contained components. Each component can have its own abstraction layer, allowing developers to work on different parts of the system independently.
// Encapsulation: Abstraction is closely related to encapsulation, which is another OOP principle. Encapsulation involves bundling data and methods together within an object and exposing a controlled interface to interact with that object. Abstraction provides a higher level of encapsulation by hiding the internal implementation details.
// Code Reusability: Abstraction promotes code reusability by creating abstract classes or interfaces that define a common set of properties and methods. These abstractions can be implemented by multiple concrete classes, providing a consistent interface for working with different objects.
// Maintenance and Flexibility: By hiding implementation details behind an abstraction layer, changes made to the underlying code are isolated and do not affect the external code that depends on the abstraction. This improves maintainability and allows for easier modifications or enhancements without impacting the entire system.
// Focus on What, not How: Abstraction enables developers to focus on the "what" aspect of a problem or system, rather than the "how." It provides a level of separation between the implementation and usage, allowing developers to think in terms of higher-level concepts and functionalities.
// Overall, abstraction is a powerful concept in software development that helps in managing complexity, improving code organization, promoting reusability, and enhancing maintainability. It allows you to create more understandable and flexible code that can adapt to changing requirements.
