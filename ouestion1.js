// Q.1 Whatâ€™s Constructor And Its Purpose?
// In object-oriented programming, a constructor is a special method or function within a class that is used to initialize objects of that class. It is called automatically when an object is created and is responsible for setting up the initial state of the object.
// The purpose of a constructor is to perform necessary setup tasks, such as initializing instance variables or acquiring resources, that are required for an object to function correctly. Constructors ensure that objects are in a valid and usable state after they are created.
// Here are some key points about constructors:
// Name and Signature: Constructors have the same name as the class they belong to. They do not have a return type, not even void, and cannot be explicitly called like regular methods. The signature of a constructor includes the name and the parameters it accepts.
// Default Constructor: If a class does not define any constructors, a default constructor is automatically provided by the compiler. It initializes the object with default values or does nothing if no initialization is required.
// Overloading Constructors: A class can have multiple constructors with different parameter lists. This is called constructor overloading. It allows objects to be created with different initial states or using different sets of parameters.
// Initialization Code: Constructors typically initialize the instance variables of an object, assign default values, or accept parameters to set specific values. They can also perform additional tasks such as validating input or allocating resources.
// Chaining Constructors: In some programming languages, constructors can call other constructors within the same class. This is known as constructor chaining and is useful when different constructors need to share common initialization code.
// Overall, constructors play a crucial role in object creation and initialization. They ensure that objects are properly set up, making them ready for use in the program.
