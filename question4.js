// Q.4 Explain OOPS ?  in java sript
// Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that allows you to structure your code around objects. It provides a way to organize and manage complex code by grouping related data and functionality together into reusable objects. JavaScript, being a versatile language, also supports OOP principles.
// In JavaScript, objects are created using constructors, which are functions that define the initial state and behavior of an object. These objects can then be used to create multiple instances with their own unique properties and methods.
// Here are the core concepts of OOP in JavaScript:
// Objects: Objects are the basic building blocks of OOP. They encapsulate data (properties) and behavior (methods) into a single entity. Objects are created using either object literals or constructor functions.
// Classes: Classes are blueprint or templates for creating objects with predefined properties and methods. JavaScript introduced class syntax in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6). A class can be thought of as a special type of function.
// Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of bundling data and methods together within an object. It allows you to control access to the internal state of an object, ensuring that data is accessed and modified only through defined methods. This helps in maintaining data integrity and code organization.
// Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. It promotes code reuse and hierarchical organization. In JavaScript, inheritance is achieved using prototypes or the newer class syntax.
// Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as interchangeable, as long as they adhere to a common interface. This means that objects can respond differently to the same method depending on their specific implementation. JavaScript achieves polymorphism through method overriding and duck typing.
// Abstraction: Abstraction focuses on hiding the internal details and complexities of objects, and exposing only the essential features. It allows you to create simplified models of real-world entities. JavaScript provides abstraction through constructors, methods, and access modifiers like public and private.
// By using OOP principles, you can create modular, reusable, and maintainable code. JavaScript's OOP capabilities provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and structure your programs, making them easier to understand and modify.
